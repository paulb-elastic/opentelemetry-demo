The following guide describes how to setup the OpenTelemetry demo with Elastic Observability using [Docker compose](#docker-compose) or [Kubernetes](#kubernetes). This fork introduces several changes to the agents used in the demo:

- The Java agent within the [Ad](../src/ad/Dockerfile.elastic), the [Fraud Detection](../src/fraud-detection/Dockerfile.elastic) and the [Kafka](../src/kafka/Dockerfile.elastic) services have been replaced with the Elastic distribution of the OpenTelemetry Java Agent. You can find more information about the Elastic distribution in [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/observability-labs/blog/elastic-distribution-opentelemetry-java-agent).
- The .NET agent within the [Cart service](../src/cart/src/Directory.Build.props) has been replaced with the Elastic distribution of the OpenTelemetry .NET Agent. You can find more information about the Elastic distribution in [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/observability-labs/blog/elastic-opentelemetry-distribution-dotnet-applications).
- The Elastic distribution of the OpenTelemetry Node.js Agent has replaced the OpenTelemetry Node.js agent in the [Payment service](../src/payment/package.json). Additional details about the Elastic distribution are available in [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/observability-labs/blog/elastic-opentelemetry-distribution-node-js).
- The Elastic distribution for OpenTelemetry Python has replaced the OpenTelemetry Python agent in the [Recommendation service](../src/recommendation/requirements.txt). Additional details about the Elastic distribution are available in [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/observability-labs/blog/elastic-opentelemetry-distribution-python).

Additionally, the OpenTelemetry Contrib collector has also been changed to the [Elastic OpenTelemetry Collector distribution](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/blob/main/internal/pkg/otel/README.md). This ensures a more integrated and optimized experience with Elastic Observability.

## Running project_a and project_b in parallel

You can run two instances of the demo side by side (e.g. to compare backends or
environments). Each instance uses its own ports and sends telemetry with a
distinct `deployment.environment` (`project_a` or `project_b`).

| Instance   | UI / Envoy port | Envoy admin | Prometheus |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| **project_a** | 8080            | 10000       | 9090       |
| **project_b** | 8081            | 10001       | 9091       |

**Start one or both:**

```bash
make start environment=project_a   # Demo UI at http://localhost:8080
make start environment=project_b   # Demo UI at http://localhost:8081
```

**Stop:**

```bash
make stop environment=project_a
make stop environment=project_b
```

Or use the shortcuts: `make start-project-a`, `make start-project-b`, `make stop-project-a`, `make stop-project-b`.

Per-instance settings (Elasticsearch endpoint, API key, ports, etc.) are in
`.env.project_a` and `.env.project_b`. Copy from `.env.project_a.example` and
`.env.project_b.example` if you need to create them.

## Docker

### Prerequisites:

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Automated Installation

#### Elasticsearch exporter (default)

1. Start a free trial on [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and copy the `Elasticsearch endpoint` and the `API Key` from the `Help -> Connection details` drop down instructions in your Kibana. These variables will be used by the [elasticsearch exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/elasticsearchexporter#elasticsearch-exporter) to authenticate and transmit data to your Elasticsearch instance.
2. Run `./demo.sh` and enter:
   - Deployment type: `cloud-hosted`
   - Platform: `docker`

#### mOTLP
1. Sign up for a free trial on [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and start an Elastic Cloud Serverless Observability type project. Select Add data, Application and then OpenTelemetry.
2. Copy the OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT URL.
3. Click "Create an API Key" to create one.
4. Run `./demo.sh` and enter:
   - Deployment type: `serverless`
   - Platform: `docker`

#### Connect to a local Elasticsearch cluster
The following steps shows how to start the Otel demo in a Docker container and send the generated otel data to an Elasticsearch instance running locally on the host.

1. Create an API key
```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9200/_security/api_key" -u USER:PASSWORD -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d'{ "name": "my_api_key" }'
```

2. Update `.env.overide` with URL and API key:
```yml
ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT="http://host.docker.internal:9200"
ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY="<api key obtained in step 2>"
```
3. Start the Otel demo in a Docker container:

```sh
make start
```

## Kubernetes
### Prerequisites:
- Create a Kubernetes cluster. There are no specific requirements, so you can create a local one, or use a managed Kubernetes cluster, such as [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), or [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service).
- Set up [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/).
- Set up [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

### Automated Installation

- **Elasticsearch exporter:** Run `./demo.sh` and enter:
  - Deployment type: `cloud-hosted`
  - Platform: `k8s`
- **mOTLP:** Run `./demo.sh` and enter:
  - Deployment type: `serverless`
  - Platform: `k8s`

### Manual Installation

<details>

- Follow the [EDOT Quick Start Guide](https://elastic.github.io/opentelemetry/quickstart/) for Kubernetes and your specific Elastic deployment to install the EDOT OpenTelemetry collector.
- Deploy the Elastic OpenTelemetry Demo using the following command.
  ```
  helm install my-otel-demo open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo --version 0.38.3 -f kubernetes/elastic-helm/demo.yml
  ```

</details>

#### Enabling Browser Traffic Generation

In the installed configuration, browser-based load generation is disabled by default to avoid CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues when sending telemetry data from simulated browser clients to the OpenTelemetry Collector. If you'd like to enable browser traffic in the load generator again:

1. Set LOCUST_BROWSER_TRAFFIC_ENABLED to "true" in kubernetes/elastic-helm/demo.yml.
2. Modify the OTLP HTTP receiver in the DaemonSet OpenTelemetry Collector values file (used in the [EDOT Quick Start Guide](https://elastic.github.io/opentelemetry/quickstart/)) to include CORS support:
   ```yaml
   receivers:
     otlp:
       protocols:
         http:
           cors:
             allowed_origins:
               - http://frontend-proxy:8080
   ```
   This configuration allows the OTLP HTTP endpoint to accept trace data from browser-based sources running at http://frontend-proxy:8080.
3. Upgrade the EDOT Quick Start deployment.

## Testing with a custom component

Suppose you want to see how your new processor is going to play out in this demo app. You can create a custom OpenTelemetry collector and test it within this demo app by following these steps:
1. Follow the instructions in the [elastic-collector-components](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-collector-components/blob/main/README.md) repo in order to build a Docker image
   that contains your custom component
2. Edit the [deployment.yaml](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/kubernetes/elastic-helm/deployment.yaml) file:
   - change the `opentelemetry-collector` [image definitions](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/27b4923ba9acd316d3726a29aad1f7e32299bc8c/kubernetes/elastic-helm/deployment.yaml#L36)
   to point at your custom image repository and tag
   - add your component configuration to the proper sub-section of the [`config` section](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/27b4923ba9acd316d3726a29aad1f7e32299bc8c/kubernetes/elastic-helm/deployment.yaml#L62). For example, if you are testing a processor, make sure to add its config to the `processors` sub-section.
   - add your component to the proper sub-section of the [`service` section](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/27b4923ba9acd316d3726a29aad1f7e32299bc8c/kubernetes/elastic-helm/deployment.yaml#L96). For example, if you are testing a logs processor, make sure to add its config to the `processors` sub-section of the `logs` pipeline.
3. If you wish to enable Kubernetes node level metrics collection, edit the [daemonset.yaml](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/kubernetes/elastic-helm/daemonset.yaml) file:
   - change the [`image` section](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/27b4923ba9acd316d3726a29aad1f7e32299bc8c/kubernetes/elastic-helm/deployment.yaml#L36)
   to point at your custom image repository and tag
   - add your component configuration to the proper sub-section of the [`config` section](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/27b4923ba9acd316d3726a29aad1f7e32299bc8c/kubernetes/elastic-helm/daemonset.yaml#L57). For example, if you are testing a processor, make sure to add its config to the `processors` sub-section.
   - add your component to the proper sub-section of the [`service` section](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/27b4923ba9acd316d3726a29aad1f7e32299bc8c/kubernetes/elastic-helm/daemonset.yaml#L309). For example, if you are testing a logs processor, make sure to add its config to the `processors` sub-section of the `logs` pipeline.
4. Apply the Helm chart changes and install it:
   ```
   # !(when running it for the first time) add the open-telemetry Helm repostiroy
   helm repo add open-telemetry https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts

   # !(when an older helm open-telemetry repo exists) update the open-telemetry helm repo
   helm repo update open-telemetry

   # deploy the demo through helm install
   helm install -f deployment.yaml my-otel-demo open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo
   ```

## Clean-up 

- **Docker**. Run `./demo.sh destroy docker`
- **Kubernetes**. Run `./demo.sh destroy k8s`
